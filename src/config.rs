/*
HOW TO CHANGE CURING TIME:

Method 1 - Quick Change:
1. Edit CURING_DURATION_SECONDS at the top of this file
2. Run: cargo build --release
3. Flash the new firmware to your Pico

Method 2 - Use Presets:
1. Comment out the current preset section
2. Uncomment your desired preset (QUICK TEST, DEEP CURE, etc.)
3. Build and flash

Method 3 - Multiple Duration Support:
For advanced users who want button-selectable durations, see the 
multi_duration_example.rs file for implementation ideas.

EXAMPLES:
- Change line 15 to: pub const CURING_DURATION_SECONDS: u64 = 30;  // 30-second cure
- Change line 15 to: pub const CURING_DURATION_SECONDS: u64 = 120; // 2-minute cure

SAFETY NOTES:
- Always test new timings with small samples first
- UV exposure can be harmful - ensure proper ventilation and eye protection
- Longer curing times generate more heat - monitor temperature
